# Standalone Pages

Standalone pages are another great way to break out of a pure documentation site and provide a simplified page to viewers. The sidebar table of contents navigation is removed in the `_config.yml` file with the following:

```
   sphinx:
     config:
       html_sidebars:
         standalone: []
```

## Sections

Sections in the *Standalone* layout have nice spacing and decorations to make theme
stand out, without conforming to the *Banner* style layout.  Background colors are
not changed and spacing is meant to imply that the section content is intended to be
read as a single page.

### Subsections

And subsections are displayed like this!
